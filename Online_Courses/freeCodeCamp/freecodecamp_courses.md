## Responsive Web Design

[My Notebook]

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

[My Notebook]

Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.

You'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

## Front End Development Libraries

[My Notebook]

Now that you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, level up your skills by learning some of the most popular front end libraries in the industry.

In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, you'll learn how to style your site quickly with Bootstrap. You'll also learn how to add logic to your CSS styles and extend them with Sass.

Later, you'll build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux.

## Data Visualization

[My Notebook]

Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.

In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.

You'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface).

#### Relational Database - 3/14 üîÑ[IN PROGRESS]

[My Notebook](D:\GitHub\important-reference-repo\Online_Courses\freeCodeCamp\SQL-Relational_Databases\relational_databases.ipynb)

For these courses, you will use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, you will learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.

Next, you will learn how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.

Finally, you will learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.

## Back End Development and APIs

[My Notebook]

Until this point, you've only used JavaScript on the front end to add interactivity to a page, solve algorithm challenges, or build an SPA. But JavaScript can also be used on the back end, or server, to build entire web applications.

Today, one of the popular ways to build applications is through microservices, which are small, modular applications that work together to form a larger whole.

In the Back End Development and APIs Certification, you'll learn how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm. You'll also build web applications with the Express framework, and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library.

## Quality Assurance

[My Notebook]

As your programs or web applications become more complex, you'll want to test them to make sure that new changes don't break their original functionality.

In the Quality Assurance Certification, you'll learn how to write tests with Chai to ensure your applications work the way you expect them to.

Then you'll build a chat application to learn advanced Node and Express concepts. You'll also use Pug as a template engine, Passport for authentication, and Socket.io for real-time communication between the server and connected clients.

## Scientific Computing with Python - 14/19üîÑ[IN PROGRESS]

[My Notebook](D:\GitHub\important-reference-repo\Online_Courses\freeCodeCamp\Scientific_Computing_with_Python\scientific_computing_with_python.ipynb)

The Scientific Computing with Python curriculum will equip you with the skills to analyze and manipulate data using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. You'll learn key concepts like data structures, algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and how to perform complex calculations using a variety of tools.

This comprehensive course will guide you through the fundamentals of scientific computing, including data structures, and algorithms.

## Data Analysis with Python

[My Notebook]

Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

## Information Security

[My Notebook]

With everything we do online, there's a vast amount of sensitive information at risk: email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and much more.

With the Information Security Certification, you'll build a secure web app with HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online.

You'll also build a TCP client, and an Nmap and port scanner in Python. This will help you learn the basics of penetration testing ‚Äî an important component of good information security.

## Machine Learning with Python

[My Notebook]

Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job.

In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.

## College Algebra with Python - 2/20 ‚è∏Ô∏è[ON HOLD]

[My Notebook](D:\GitHub\important-reference-repo\Online_Courses\freeCodeCamp\College_Algebra_with_Python\college_algebra_with_python.ipynb) - _this is a focus on more financial math that I won't really need including quadratic equations_

This course is designed as a one-semester college course. It consists of instructional videos, with Google Colaboratory notebooks to follow along interactively, assignments, and challenging projects.

As you go through each part of this course in sequence, you will gain a full understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve Algebra problems.

Throughout this course, you will also build your own Algebra Colab notebook that you will be able to use as your custom calculator. This course (and the code you write here) will give you the foundation for a deeper math and data science understanding.

## Legacy Responsive Web Design Challenges

[My Notebook]

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

## Legacy JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

[My Notebook]

While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).

## Legacy Python for Everybody
