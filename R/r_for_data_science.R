# Chapter: Whole Game ----------------------------------------------------------

# for the first exercise we will need to install the palmerpenguins package which has a penguins dataset
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes) # this is a supplementary package to ggplot2 which includes more theme options for the visuals

# main question: do penguins with longer flippers weigh more or less than penguins with shorter flippers?
# other question: what does the relationship between flipper length and body mass look like?

# first want to look at the data frame of the penguins to know what the data looks like and what we are working with
penguins # this shows the top of the dataset

glimpse(penguins) # this shows each column available in the dataset and then the first couple of observations for each column 

# from this we can see the main variables we need are: species, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g

# to start by creating the plot, we need to define the plot object and then add the layers to it
ggplot(data = penguins)
# right now this is empty, we need to add mapping arguments so it knows what visuals we want
# the mapping visual properties are 'aesthetics' using the aes() function
# we use the aes() to define the x and y arguments for the x and y axis 
# since we want to look at flipper length and body mass we will use those
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
)
# the graph right now is blank because it still needs more structure
# as of right now it doesnt know how to graph the actual penguin data so we need to tell it how
# geom - the geometric object that a plot uses to represent the data (ex: bar graph, line graph, plots, boxplot, etc.)

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point()
# running this will result in a warning message:
# "Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point())."
# this is because two of the penguins either dont have a flipper length or body mass so they couldn't be plotted

# for scatterplots the easiest thing to do to add to the visual is doing different colored points
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_point()
# this will show different colors by grouping the species together 
# ggplot will automatically add colors (process called scaling) but you can specify colors too 
# another thing to do is adding a smoothing curve to show the trends in the plots
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") # smoothing is to add the line and "lm" is to say we want to draw a line of best fit based on the linear model
# using the method this way the lines are separated because the colors are separated in the aes() function aka the global level but if we move it to the geom_point() function aka the local level then its a singular line
ggplot(
  data = penguins, 
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# to account for color blindness or issues with visualizing the colors, adding different shapes to the plots is another way to differentiate the data
ggplot(
  data = penguins, 
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# another thing is adding labels so it's easier to understand because sometimes the variable names from the table are coding in a way other people might not understand
# you would use the lab() function for this

  data = penguins,

# Visualizing distribution: Categorical vs Numerical

# For categorical variables:
# a variable is categorical if it can only take one of a small set of values
# Most of the time we will be using bar charts for this data 
# the height of the bar shows how many observations there are for each x value
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +

# a variable is numerical (quantitative) if it can take on a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values
# a common visual for this is the histogram
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)
# it is always worth playing around with the binwidth because if there are too many observations the lines are too narrow and it will be hard to read
# the higher the number the less bars and the thicker and easier they are to read

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, color = species, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) # the transparency is between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque)

# for three or more numeric variables: 
# we can use the visual of the scatterplot but add other aesthetics for the other variables like color for one and shape for another variable

# another option is using the facet_wrap() argument where it splits the visual into multiple different facets (which are just subsets of the data)

# Chapter: Visualize -----------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)

# when using shapes, there are a max of 6 discrete (unique) values that can be used so if you have more than that, it's best to use something else like color 
# size is also not the best idea if there are too many discrete values because then the whole plot will just look like a giant blob 

# R has 26 built-in shapes that are identified by numbers. There are some seeming duplicates: for example, 0, 15, and 22 are all squares. The difference comes from the interaction of the color and fill aesthetics. The hollow shapes (0–14) have a border determined by color; the solid shapes (15–20) are filled with color; the filled shapes (21–25) have a border of color and are filled with fill. Shapes are arranged to keep similar shapes next to each other.

# to see the different aesthetic options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Exercises:
# 1. Create a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ where the points are pink filled in triangles.
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(shape = 24, fill = "pink")
# shapes are used by numbers instead of names 

# 2. Why did the following code not result in a plot with blue points?
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
# Your code did not result in blue points because "blue" is placed inside aes(), treating it as a categorical variable rather than setting the actual color.
# the fixed code is below:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue")

# 3. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)
?geom_point
# for shapes that have borders: Use the stroke aesthetic to modify the width of the border

# 4. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(color = displ < 5)? Note, you’ll also need to specify x and y.
# it evaluates the expression for each row in the dataset and treats it as a categorical (logical) variable so:
# displ < 5 returns TRUE or FALSE for each row 
# ggplot2 treats these logical values as discrete categories 
# the plot will use a different color for TRUE (displ < 5) and FALSE (displ >= 5)
# a legend will be created showing the two groups (TRUE and FALSE)
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #


# the aesthetics can be used for geom_point() and geom_smooth() but not all aesthetics can be mapped to both like shape for _smooth 
# for geom_smooth() you could use linetype:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv)) +
  geom_smooth()
# another option to make it even more clear is to actually stack the two on top of each other:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv))
# aesthetics for each geom is the mapping for that layer only which makes it possible to see multiple overlapping aesthetics per layer 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth()

# the local layer aesthetics override the global aesthetics too:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(
    data = mpg |> filter(class == "2seater"),
    color = "red"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data = mpg |> filter(class == "2seater"),
    shape = "circle open", size = 3, color = "red"
  )

# ggplot2 only has 40 geoms but there are more expansion packs for more visuals for whatever you need
# one other example is the ggridges package that can make ridge lines which are useful for visualizing density of numeric variables based on categorical variables 
install.packages("ggridges")
library(ggridges)

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Exercises
# 1. What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?
# line = geom_line()
# boxplot = geom_boxplot()
# histogram = geom_histogram()
# area chart = geom_area()

# 2. Earlier in this chapter we used show.legend without explaining it:

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)

# What does show.legend = FALSE do here? What happens if you remove it? Why do you think we used it earlier?
# it removes the legend in the visual which can be good to compare multiple visuals that have the same legend so it doesn't get in the way 

# 3. What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?
?geom_smooth
# Display confidence interval around smooth? (TRUE by default, see level to control.)

# 4. Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs. Note that wherever a categorical variable is used in the plot, it’s drv.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "blue", se = FALSE)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv), se = FALSE)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv), se = FALSE)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv, linetype = drv), se = FALSE)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = drv), shape = 21, color = "white", stroke = 1)

# facet_wrap() is used to split a plot into subplots based on categorical variables:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~cyl)

# but if you want to use two variables, you would use facet_grid() instead 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
# it defaults to the same scale for the ranges of x and y but to have it autoscale then use "free_x", "free_y" or "free" for both
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales = "free")

# Exercises 

# 1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
# it will convert the continuous variable into bins 
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ cty)

# 2. What do the empty cells in the plot above with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? Run the following code. How do they relate to the resulting plot?

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = drv, y = cyl))

# it means there are no data points for those categories

# 3. What plots does the following code make? What does . do?

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
# this makes 3 different horizontal graphs

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
# this makes 3 different vertical graphs

# `.` is just a placeholder so that we can have a facet in only one dimension. 
# This is necessary because sometimes one sided formulae can cause problems.

# 4. Take the first faceted plot in this section:

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 2)

# What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

# its easier to see the data groupings for each category but its hard to compare the categories together 
# It is difficult to resolve more than a dozen or so discrete colours, but we can have a larger number of facets than that. On the other hand, facets can be harder to read at a glance, or if the cells being compared aren't lined up in the required dimension. So in a situation like this, colours are probably better, but if we had more classes, or wanted to use colour for a different variable, facets would come into their own.

# 5. Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?
?facet_wrap
# nrow is number of rows
# ncol is number of columns 
# you can change the order of the panels
?facet_grid
# because there are only ever a set number of rows and cols depending on the two variables
# In `facet_wrap`, `nrow` and `ncol` control the numbers of rows and columns, but in `facet_grid` these are implied by the faceting variables. `dir` also controls the placement of the individual panels, and so isn't an argument of `facet_grid`.

# 6. Which of the following plots makes it easier to compare engine size (displ) across cars with different drive trains? What does this say about when to place a faceting variable across rows or columns?

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
# this one is easier to compare the grouping/skewness of each type of drive trains for comparison between them

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(. ~ drv)
# this one is easier to compare counts but harder to see the skinnier lines

# 7. Recreate the following plot using facet_wrap() instead of facet_grid(). How do the positions of the facet labels change?

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ drv, nrow = 3)
# it now shows the labels for drv on top of the graph instead of the right side

# there are a bunch of geoms that auto calculate stats for their displays like geom_bar using the count of variables # you are able to change the way it calculates these stats by specifying something different
# if you want to use identity instead of count you would do:
diamonds |>
  count(cut) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

# another option is displaying proportions instead of counts 
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) + 
  geom_bar()

# another option is a stat summary which summarized the y values for each unique x value
ggplot(diamonds) +
  stat_summary(
    aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max, 
    fun = median
  )

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# Exercises
# 1. What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?
# geom_pointrange()
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.min = min, 
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
    )

# 2. What does geom_col() do? How is it different from geom_bar()?
?geom_col
# its like geom_bar but the heights of the bars represent values in the data 

# 3. Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common? (Hint: Read through the documentation.)

# Complementary geoms and stats:
# geom                  | stat
# geom_bar()	            stat_count()
# geom_bin2d()	          stat_bin_2d()
# geom_boxplot()	        stat_boxplot()
# geom_contour_filled()	  stat_contour_filled()
# geom_contour()	        stat_contour()
# geom_count()	          stat_sum()
# geom_density_2d()	      stat_density_2d()
# geom_density()	        stat_density()
# geom_dotplot()	        stat_bindot()
# geom_function()	        stat_function()
# geom_sf()	              stat_sf()
# geom_sf()	              stat_sf()
# geom_smooth()	          stat_smooth()
# geom_violin()	          stat_ydensity()
# geom_hex()	            stat_bin_hex()
# geom_qq_line()	        stat_qq_line()
# geom_qq()	              stat_qq()
# geom_quantile()	        stat_quantile()

# 4.  What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What arguments control its behavior?
?stat_smooth
# Aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting
# The function stat_smooth() calculates the following variables:
# - y: predicted value
# - ymin: lower value of the confidence interval
# - ymax: upper value of the confidence interval
# - se: standard error

# 5. In our proportion bar chart, we needed to set group = 1. Why? In other words, what is the problem with these two graphs?

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop))) + 
  geom_bar()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = after_stat(prop))) + 
  geom_bar()

# with the group = 1 not included the bars will have the same height and it won't show anything valuable 

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# bar charts ca be either outlined in color or filled with color 
# if you map the fill to another variable that isnt the x or y, it stackes the colors on top of one another in the bars 
# there is a position argument when you have stacked bars
# they are: 
# - identity
# - dodge 
# - fill 

# identity keeps the bars exactly where they fall and additives like alpha (transparency) and fill = N/A (just an outline) can be used in combination to make the categories easier to see
# fill is stacked bars but for % so the bars are fully set to 100 and the categories within are the percentages of 100 so its useful for seeing with the overall categories but not for comparing with one another 
# dodge puts all the subcategories side by side instead of stacked so it makes a bunch of bars which is good to compare overall but not within the overarching categories 

# if you have a dataset with a lot of data especially with points and there are many that have the same you run into issues of overplotting 
# to help this you can add the position "jitter" that will not keep the points on such uniforms lines so its easier to see larger clumps compared to one or two by themselves 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
# this is better to use with larger data sets rather than smaller data sets 

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Exercises 
# 1. What is the problem with the following plot? How could you improve it?
  
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
    geom_point()

  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(position = "jitter") # adding jitter will make it easier to read 
  
# 2. What, if anything, is the difference between the two plots? Why?
  
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "identity")
# no difference?

# 3. What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?
# width and height 
  
# 4. Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().
# The geom geom_jitter() adds random variation to the locations points of the graph. In other words, it “jitters” the locations of points slightly. This method reduces overplotting since two points with the same location are unlikely to have the same random variation.
# However, the reduction in overlapping comes at the cost of slightly changing the x and y values of the points.
# The geom geom_count() sizes the points relative to the number of observations. Combinations of (x, y) values with more observations will be larger than those with fewer observations.

# 5. What’s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.
# default position is dodge2 and this can be either horizontal or vertical 

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# there is also the ability to use actual map coordinates to map locations on a graph
