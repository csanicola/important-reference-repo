## Basics of R 
### Basic Computations Objects
- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
- Modulo: `%%`
___
- **objects** are values used in R 
  - a **variable** is an object
  - an object is a named instance of a data structure
  - data structures in R are **vectors**, **factors**, **matrices**, **arrays**, **lists**, and **data frames**
- to store any computation or value as a variable you would use the assignment operator:
  - `x <- 2+3`

- calling a function is: `function_name()`
  - examples of functions:
    - `ceiling()` returns the ceiling (an upper usually prescribed limit) of your input
    - `floor()` returns the floor (a lower usually prescribed limit) of your input 
    - `round()` rounds your input to the closest integer - it rounds a number in 0.5 to the closest even integer:
      - ex: 2.5 = 2; 3.5 = 4
___
- to see what the current working directory is you would use `getwd()`
  - to change the working directory, you would use `setwd()`
___
- before you do anything else, you need to install packages that are used in R 
  - the most important one is `tidyverse`
    - `install.packages('tidyverse')`
      - to call the package: `library(tidyverse)`
___
## Data Structures in R 
- each individual value in R has a type: **logical**, **integer**, **double** or **character**
  - you can use `typeof()` to find the type of vector 
- **double** is a numeric value with a stored decimal
- an **integer** is a whole number without a decimal
  - to indicate we want the number to be an integer object, you need to use `L` after the number 
- **characters** have letters
- **logicals** or **booleans** are `TRUE` and `FALSE`
  - **booleans** can actually be interpreted as `0`/`1` and can be used in logic: ex: `TRUE + FALSE + TRUE` = 2
### Vectors 
- Vectors are one-dimensional data structures that cna store multiple data types of the same type (ex: character, Boolean, numeric)
- You can confirm if something is a vector by using: `is.vector()`
- Creating a vector:
  - combine multiple values using the `c()` function 
    - vectors can only store the same type of value, so if you try and combine a string and a integer, it will convert the integer to a string 
    - the `class()` function returns the data structure of an object 
    - you can create an empty vectio by leaving the `c()` blank
      - you can also set the type of the empty vector:
        - `ex_empty <- vector(mode="numeric")`
  - you can create a vector with `req()` or `seq()`
    - `req(x, times)` takes the value (x) and a number of times and outputs x the number of times entered
    - `seq(from, to step)` takes a numeric starting value (from) and an end value (to) and step size (step) which specifies the sequence to get from the **from** to the **to** value (or the maximum that can get close based on the step value)

#### Indexing a vector 
- when a vector is created, you can access certain values in it by indexing []
  - `vector[1]`
- not only can you access a single value, but a subset of the values using `c()`
  - `vector[c(1,4)]`
- another option is to associate a name with each value
  - `names(rain) <- days`
- another option is using `TRUE` and `FALSE` values to index the values in a vector (both vectors need to be the same length)
  - so when you index the vector, it will only show the `TRUE` values

#### Modifying a Vector and Calculations
- exp() - exponential
- log() - log
- sqrt() - square root
- abs() - absolute value
- round() - round to nearest integer value
- ceiling() - round up to the nearest integer value
- floor() - round down to the nearest integer value
- signif(, dig) - round to dig number of significant digits
- the above logical functions can be used to combine vectors or as operators on vector values
- you can also change values in a vector: `rain["Friday"] <- 0.5`
- adding additional entries to a vector is possible too 
  - `days <- c(days, "Saturday", "Sunday")`
  - to check the current length of a vector, you can use the `length()` function 
- you can also get the sum, max, and min of a vector using the functions:
  - `sum()`
  - `max()`
  - `min()`

#### Common Vector Functions
- below are some of the most common vector functions available in R 
- sum() - summation
- median() - median value
- mean() - mean
- sd() - standard deviation
- var() - variance
- max() - maximum value
- which.max() - index of the first element with the maximum value
- min() - minimum value
- which.min() - index of the first element with the minimum value

- you can also use the `sort()` function to sort the values
- and the `order()` function to see the order of the values which have the smallest and highest values
- for both `order()` and `sort()`, they have the extra argument of `decreasing` which can be set to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`

### Factors 
- a special kind of vector that behaves like a regular vector, except that it represents values from a category
- it keeps track of all possible values of that category in what are called levels of the factor 
- the function `as.factor()` converts a vector to a factor
  - using the `factor()` function instead of `as.factor()` will let you specify the levels of the factor even if there are more levels that current values of the factor 
  ```r 
  days_fct <- factor(days, 
                    levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", 
                                "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
  ```
- you may not have all the values in the factor as what you are specifying in the levels but thats just telling when a new value is inserted, what level the new value will take
- factors can also be used for numeric vectors 
- if we want to have 0/1 to represent whether a day is a weekend or not, this is something we can do with factor levels
