```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('GGally')
install.packages('gt')
install.packages('gtsummary')

library(tidyverse)
library(HDSinRdata)
library(GGally)
library(gt)
library(gtsummary)
```

First we need to load in the data
This data is from the [Sr_Data_Analyst_Project1 Notebook]('https://github.com/csanicola/important-reference-repo/blob/822febba0fca0a5ba7bc20c3fe333594ffe51ce6/Practice/sr_data_analyst_project1.ipynb') that created fake healthcare data for analysis purposes

We then want to look at the head of the data to see what it looks like and if the correct csv was loaded in.
```{r}
df <- read.csv('D:/GitHub/important-reference-repo/Data/fake_healthcare_data_v2.csv')
head(df)
```
To get a bit more detailed overview of what type of data is in this dataframe, we can use the `summary()` function
```{r}
summary(df)
```
